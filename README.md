# AI-Image-Generator-
Stable Diffusion v1.4 generates high-quality images from text prompts using Hugging Faceâ€™s Diffusers. Running on CPU (no CUDA), it utilizes PyTorch for deep learning. Outputs are saved as `new_stable_diffusion_output.png`. It supports prompt-based regeneration and can be optimized for GPU. Ideal for creative AI-driven image synthesis. 


There two branches in this repository. Do check both they are different in implementation.
